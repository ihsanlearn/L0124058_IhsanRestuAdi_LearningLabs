# Learning Labs 2024 - Ihsan

This is a portfolio website created to showcase my projects, skills, and personal information in a professional (maybe) and user-friendly way. The website is designed with a responsive layout, utilizing modern web development practices to ensure optimal performance on different devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Includes a hamburger menu for easy navigation on smaller screens.
- **Feedback Form**: Users can provide feedback directly on the website.
- **Sections**: Organized into sections for products, anime, and more, each with links and descriptions.
- **Authentication Links**: Sign In and Sign Up links are styled for user interaction (non-functional in this demo).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For basic structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for responsive design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To manage interactive elements, such as the hamburger menu (using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for state management).
